# Real-time monitoring of reaction mechanisms from spectroscopic data using hidden semi-Markov models for mode identification

Description of the datasets:
1. The spectroscopic data associated with a chemical reaction process subject to a decreasing temperature sequence can be found in the Decreasing_temperature_data.csv file. 

2. The spectroscopic data associated when a similar process is subject to a randomized sequence of temperature changes can be found in the Randomized_temperature_data.csv file.

In both the datasets the first column contains the temperature sequence, the second colunmn contains the randomly sampled residence time durations at each of the temperatures, and the remaining columns are the spectral absorbances recorded at channels specified in the wavenumbers.csv file.
